(use-package sbt-mode
  :ensure t
  :defer t
  :commands sbt-start sbt-command
  :config

  (substitute-key-definition
   'minibuffer-complete-word
   'self-insert-command
   minibuffer-local-completion-map)
  ;; sbt-supershell kills sbt-mode:  https://github.com/hvesalai/emacs-sbt-mode/issues/152
  (setq sbt:program-options '("-Dsbt.supershell=false")))
