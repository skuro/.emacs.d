;; Enable scala-mode for highlighting, indentation and motion commands
(use-package scala-mode
  :ensure t
  :defer t
  :interpreter
  ("scala" . scala-mode))

;; Enable sbt mode for executing sbt commands
(use-package sbt-mode
  :ensure t
  :defer t
  :commands sbt-start sbt-command
  :config
  ;; WORKAROUND: https://github.com/ensime/emacs-sbt-mode/issues/31
  ;; allows using SPACE when in the minibuffer
  (substitute-key-definition
   'minibuffer-complete-word
   'self-insert-command
   minibuffer-local-completion-map)
  ;; sbt-supershell kills sbt-mode:  https://github.com/hvesalai/emacs-sbt-mode/issues/152
  (setq sbt:program-options '("-Dsbt.supershell=false")))
